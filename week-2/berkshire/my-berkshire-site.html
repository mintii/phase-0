- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was exciting to use my previous knowledge to copy the Berkshire Hathways website into something my partner and I coded. It's cool to look at the end and see how they set up everything in HTML.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It's like relearning to tie your shoes. It's frustrating, but I do understand it's all with good intentions. It's certainly something I need to work better on in th future. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think I did a good job on this. I have experience with HTML and CSS prior to DBC, so what I kept noticing was I would say what we need to put down, and then explain to my partner why in a broader sense. For example "We need to put this info into a div here because later we can turn it into a class and do cool things with it in our stylesheet."

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It's good because it keeps one's focus simply on the structure of the papge. It's bad because HTML in the past was used quite differently than what we use today. Therefore it takes conscious coding to create one thing in HTML while also implementing a function that will be built upon more and more with CSS and Javascript. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
If it's something that can be moved around or will be styled differently than the surrounding elements, it probably can be put in a div. If it can be put into a div, check to see what semantic tags are available for it in HTML5. :)
