# 2.3 Reflections

## 1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The 6 phases of the Website Design include: 
	- Information Gathering
	- Planning
	- Design
	- Development
	- Testing and Delivery
	-Maintenance

## 2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
This will be a professional website which incorporates a broad-spectrum blog, as well as any projects and events I'm working on. I envision my blog being the largest focus of the website and how someone would really get to know who I am. 
I want to keep most of the website very casual and relaxed Just like if a visitor were to come and visit my home. 

## 3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
I am targeting other newbie coders, female developers, and women of color interested in technology. It would provide them visibility and narratives on what it's like being a young professional female developer. People who are looking for blogs relating to psychology and tech would also find my site of interest. 

## 4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
They should check out the new blog posts or projects listed on the homepage. I aim to keep clear call to actions on how a user should enter and interact with my page. 


## 5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
## 6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
(To answer both of these questions)
Someone should know that it's a super new field in tech and it is helping to make the internet a friendly and engaging place. :) 

A focus on user experiences while building and maintaining websites is recommended from the smallest and simplest of sites to the largest and most complex of sites. Many view it as an unnecessary component to production because it's hard to clearly and concretely research trends. Any data gathered within UX is usually passed through qualitative analyses. 

Designing websites now need to be more than beautifully designed and interesting. It needs to illicit (compelling, and hopefully positive)emotion from the user that causes them to stick around and experience all that you offer. User experience is very similar to how companies will go through lots of testing to make the best drinking cup. 

## 7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Nothing tedious about the challenge today! I have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, so learning about design gives me a new perspective to approaching my websites.
