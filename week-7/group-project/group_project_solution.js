/*
  As a user, I want to three tasks that each give me back some 
calculations. I want one task named sum that will give me back the sum of 
everything that's on a list. It should first give me back items on the list that
have an odd length, followed by items on the list that have an even length. 
     Secondly, I want a task named mean that wll give me back the average of 
all the items on a list. Just as before, it should give me back itemson the
list that have an odd length, and then the items hat have an even length. 
      Finally, I want a task named median that will give me the median number 
of all the items on a list that has an odd lenth. And then I want the median
number of all the items on a list that has an even length. 
 
 I've already given you a list to work with that's odd and even: 
 oddLengthArray  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7]
 evenLengthArray = [4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7]
