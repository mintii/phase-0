  As a user, I want to three tasks that each give me back some 
calculations. I want one task named sum that will give me back the sum of 
everything that's on a list. It should first give me back items on the list that
have an odd length, followed by items on the list that have an even length. 
     Secondly, I want a task named mean that wll give me back the average of 
all the items on a list. Just as before, it should give me back itemson the
list that have an odd length, and then the items hat have an even length. 
      Finally, I want a task named median that will give me the median number 
of all the items on a list that has an odd lenth. And then I want the median
number of all the items on a list that has an even length. 
 
 I've already given you a list to work with that's odd and even: 
 oddLengthArray  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7]
 evenLengthArray = [4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7]

Our group was sucessful in passing all 9 tests successfully! There was a bit of 
a mixup with the arrays and where they should be placed in the code for it to 
even pass the test But they were easily relocated up to the top of the page, and
that allowed for the code to run and then for the tests to check for completeness. 
Good job team! :)
